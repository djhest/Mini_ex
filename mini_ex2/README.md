1. **DESCRIBE YOUR CODING PROCESS**
 - I started off by making the background as a lot of rectangles, which seems as very complicated way of doing it. The i tried to make a cartoonish head with an eye and a mouth. I wanted to make it follow the mouse, so i did that. Then i thought it was done, until i saw a few more videoes by Daniel Shiffman. After those videoes i added random coloring to both the background and the cartoonish head, i added a click function, i added sound and i played around with the frameRate.
 
2. **WHAT CONSTITUTES A PROGRAM?**
 - A program is a bunch of commands for something to execute. If the commands are given in the right language and without faults the program will execute correctly.
 
3. **WHAT IS ERROR TO YOU?**
 - For me error is when something doesn't go as expected. Fx if a program can't run exactly, there is an error. Errors are not only in programming. Metaphorically they are everywhere. If something doesn't work the way you want to you can call it an error. Something went wrong in the "code".
