**What is your selected coding challenge?**
- I have chosen the coding challenge named phyllotaxis(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWoJgHFYWxY).


**What function/syntax have you added?**
- I have changed different values for the colors and how it changes through the program. I have also changed what the result looks like. Instead of the result in the CC video i have made the result look slightly different.
I have added an if statement as well to make the rotation and drawing of ellipses stop when there are 2500 ellipses in total.

**What is the difficulty of this week mini exercise?**
- I think the difficulty of this mini ex is to find out what you wanna change in the chosen program without ruining it completely. Every CC video has a nice result when the program is executed, so you dont really wanna change anything. 

**How may we see, organize and communicate things differently by using a flow chart?**
- By using flowcharts its easier to understand how a certain program works and it gives you a nice overview of the program and its functions etc. 
People who dont know code can also get a better understanding of the program by looking at a flowchart. That means that a flowchart suddenly becomes a way for the author to communicate the program in a better way.
