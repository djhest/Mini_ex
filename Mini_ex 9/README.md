**Which API have you chosen? and Why?**
- I have chosen an API from open-notify.org that have data on how many people there are in space at the moment. The reason why i chose that one is that i wanted an API which could give a number as data. Not many API's that i came across did that. It was clear for me that i wanted a number as data so that i could visually illustrate something somehow. So i ended up with this one.

**Can you describe your process of making this mini exercise in terms of acquiring, processing, using and representing data?**
- I had a lot of trouble with this mini ex. The hardest part about it is the URL you have to make to get something out of it and how to change that URL by making for loops and so on. At first i wanted to use the NASA API to get images of earth, but it would require three different URLs that is three different JSON files and i couldnt figure that one out. Also i couldnt figure out how to call images from the JSON file so i gave up on that idea.
By trying a lot of different ways to acquire data i found the right way to do it, so that became pretty easy to do. As i said before i knew i wanted to visually illustrate something so i had to find an API that gave whole numbers as data. That i found rather challenging. And since it is easter the time and motivation was low, so it became a really simple program and i am honestly not really satisfied with the result. 

**What is your reflection on the aesthetics of (big) data?**
- Most of the APIs i came across was actually made only for integration in an app. So it was really hard to find the one and only API. I find it really exciting and satisfying to look at big data. It gives another perspective on the given topic so to speak. I think that looking at big data for example on Facebook can change your behavior on, in this example, social medias. 
It is also really helpful for companies who wants to put ads on the web. They can get information on where to put it and which key words to attach it to. So it can be really advantageous for a lot of people.
