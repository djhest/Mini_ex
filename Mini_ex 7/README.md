I got this idea at tuesdays lesson and i really wanted it to workout. It took a lot of struggling to get the value of the sliders to work properly. But i figured it out after watching Shifmans movie on the slider dance. After i got it to work i wanted to make it more like a real sound mixer that shows whether the sound is too loud or at an ok level. Thats what the red, yellow and green colors show. I kinda missed the interactive part about this exercise. I was trying to implement the drop function so that the user could drop a song of their choice on to the canvas and that song would be played. But i couldnt figure out how to use the drop function with audio. The only interactive thing in this program is the toggle button which toggles the song. I was also trying to figure out how to make the gif pause and play according to the toggle button as well but i couldnt figure that out either(FIXED). So i ended up with this. The gif should fit the beat of almost every song. 

This program doesnt work on safari and google chrome as far as i know. 

**What are the advantages in using objects and what might be the limitations? What's your experience in using objects?**
- I think that form art is a great way to rethink objects and their daily use. Normally the HTML objects doesnt get that much attention even though they are a really big part of fx a webpage. It was fun to be creative with these objects and use them for something different and in my program i like that the sliders are doing their own thing and that they do not depend on human actions. I wanted to focus on visualizing some data by using objects. Giving them a different assignment than usual you might say.
