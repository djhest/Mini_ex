READ INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE RUNNING!

INSTRUCTIONS:
REACH THE SUN/MOON

RIGHT ARROW = CHANGE THE SUN TO THE MOON

LEFT ARROW = CHANGE BACK TO THE SUN

UP ARROW = SPEED UP

DOWN ARROW = SPEED DOWN

SPACEBAR = IF YOU ARE AT MAX SPEED PRESS SPACEBAR TO INITIATE HYPER SPEED

[JOURNEY TO THE SUN/MOON - SPACE FLIGHT SIMULATOR](https://djhest.github.io/Mini_ex/Mini_ex4/index.html)
 
1. **A SHORT DESCRIPTIOM OF YOUR WORK AND TELL US HOW YOUR WORK DEMONSTRATES THE NOTION OF FEEDBACK AND CYBERNETICS**
 - The program runs a very simple space flight simulator where the goal is to reach either the sun or the moon. That is up to the user. 
   The user has to travel 10.000.000 light years to reach the goal. The program is really just a loop running over and over again. The loop consists of star like objects travelling from the center and out of the canvas. 
	 I found it kind of boring at first but i liked the idea. So i decided to make it into a journey to the sun/moon. I also made it possible to alter the loop. Give it some input which changes something and then the program gives an output according to the input.
   The user gives input by pressing keys on the keyboard which changes the loop in different ways and then the loop gives an output. 

 - My program can be compared to the radar-tech in the text that can calculate when to fire a weapon by receiving some data and then change some numbers in the system. 
	 My program has a set of data which can be altered by the user. When altered, the loop behaves differently according to the changed data. When this data is changed the program gives feedback in different ways. Fx when you change the speed. The stars are moving faster. The speed-o-meter increases and the distance left decreases. That is the kind of feedback the loop gives. 
	 Although a loop shouldnt end i decided to make an end goal which is to reach the sun/moon. It takes a lot of time to reach it and therefore i thought it was okay to make it end because you will probably not wait till the end.
