1. **DESCRIBE A BIT ABOUT YOUR THROBBER DESIGN**
 - At first i wanted to make a throbber inspired by the Google Chrome color scheme and so i did. But as i got further into the proces of making my throbber, things happened and i made some other decisions, changed some values and added a spinning triangle in the center of the throbber which ended up being my final design. The picture of the dude is just for fun.
 
2. **HOW MAY WE USE PROGRAMMING TO REFLECT AND INQUIRE DIGITAL (VISUAL) CULTURE?**
 - When working with digital products like computers no one wants to wait for it loading or anything else that takes time away from you. Therefore the throbber is wonderful thing because when shown the user doesnt think about the time wasted by waiting on the computer. 
 Although some throbbers aren't that good at getting the users attention and therefore the user gets frustrated because of the waiting. I like throbbers that are getting full attention from the user, throbbers that activates the user while waiting or gives the user something to look at. Its like sitting in a room waiting for the dentist. If you dont have anything to do you will get frustrated. 
 In the digital culture waiting is not appreciated and therefore the throbber should activate the user with something. Either some kind of game like youtube's snake game throbber or at least something aesthatically beautiful to look at.
