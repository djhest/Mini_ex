 **Description**
 - I found it really hard to understand the logic behind the RiTa library so i looked at a lot of examples on the web and was very much influenced by a tutorial. What the program does is called a word cloud i think. I wanted to grab the 5 most famous speeches and make a word cloud out of the text with focus on the words used the most. So the most used words will appear bigger than others. I have also loaded the recorded speech so it will play when each button is pressed.

**What kind of functions have I used from RiTa library?**
 -  The program contains one RiTa function which is called RiTaconcordance(). The function counts the amount of times a certain word appears in a loaded text file. The program shows every word of the given text file and the textSize is based on how many times a word appears in the text. 
 
**Can you describe your experience in working with found text as the source materials?**
- It was fairly easy to work with the text as source materials and I even find it very interesting working with text because it is able to tell something directly instead of figures, shapes and movement showing something. The RiTa library was where i struggled. I couldnt have made this without a tutorial, but i learned while watching the tutorial.
 
**How might we think about the materiality of text/interface? How might we understand the “textual character” of the found text?**
- In my program i dont think that the found text is that important. I merely think of the way the program uses the text and how it makes it into an experience for the user. So when talking about materiality of text/interface and electronic literature i think that it is most important to clearly show what you want to tell the user with your text. That is to make a program that visualizes what you want to be said. This program visualizes most frequently used words in the 5 most famous speeches of all time. It is then up to the user how to grasp that information and what to think about it.
