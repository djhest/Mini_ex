I worked on several different projects before finally deciding on the above. I couldnt really decide which one to go with until the deadline came closer. The program seems pretty simple. It creates a shape which is based on TWO_PI therefore it is round as an ellipse. 
The wobbly edges are made by the noise function and is generated randomly every time so the result is never the same. The internet has yet again been helpful so SO to that. I couldnt decide on using random colors or a set of definite colors and ended up with the last mentioned. I thought that the to colors would match pretty well so i just went with it.

**What are the rules that you have employed in your program?**
1. There shape has a minimum and a maximum radius and it moves inside that interval.
2. Theres on color and only one, so thats kinda anti-generative. I just thougt that random colors would be too much.
3. I could make up a third rule cause it would be something like the whole shape moving inside the canvas, but i really wanted it to stay in the middle. 

**By using some of the concepts from the article - Generative Art Theory, can you discuss how is your program expressed the notion of generativity?**

This program randomly generating a shape from defined values and a noise function. The shapes is different every time and it is behaving differently every time. Which means that it is a non-human creation. Anyone can run this program from their computer and get a unique shape. Thats where the discussion about ownership starts. And who made the shape. The program or the creator of the program?
I do mean that the ownership of every shape created by a program belongs to the creator of the program. And therefore it is kind of made by human. Even though the creator cant predict the shape because of its randomness.
